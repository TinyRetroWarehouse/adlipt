## Usage

### EMM386 or QEMM

Load the TSR with the command:

    ADLIPT LPT1

assuming the OPL2LPT board is plugged into LPT1. It will use about
half a kilobyte of RAM. It can be loaded into high memory using the
DOS `LH` command.

The TSR can be unloaded with the command:

    ADLIPT UNLOAD

### JEMM

Load ADLiPT using the command:

    JLOAD JADLIPT.DLL LPT1


## Requirements

- 386 CPU
- A compatible memory manager:
  - EMM386 version 4.46 or later (tested with version 4.49 from MS-DOS 6.22)
  - QEMM 7.03 or later (tested with QEMM versions 7.03, 7.5, 8.0, 9.01)
  - JEMM 5.78

EMS memory is _not_ required. If you don't use software that requires
EMS memory, you can load EMM386 with the `NOEMS` parameter.

## Building

Compiles with OpenWatcom. Use the `build.sh` script.
