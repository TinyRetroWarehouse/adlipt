# ADLiPT

ADLiPT is a driver for the "Adlib on a parallel port" OPL2LPT board.
For more information, see [the thread on the Vogons forum][1].

## Download

Download the driver from [the Github releases tab][2].

## Usage

### EMM386 or QEMM

Load the TSR with the command:

    ADLIPT

assuming the OPL2LPT board is plugged into LPT1. It will use about a
kilobyte of RAM. It can be loaded into high memory using the DOS `LH`
command.

The TSR can be unloaded with the command:

    ADLIPT UNLOAD

### JEMM

Load ADLiPT using the command:

    JLOAD JADLIPT.DLL

### Options

- **`OPL3`** Enable OPL3 support. Use this if you have an OPL3LPT.

- **`LPT1`/`LPT2`/`LPT3`** Select printer port.

- **`BLASTER=220`** Enable Sound Blaster FM emulation. ADLiPT will
  intercept the Sound Blaster FM ports in addition to the standard
  Adlib ports. (It won't however fake enough of a Sound Blaster to
  pass installation checks, so this won't be very useful if you don't
  have a Sound Blaster.)

- **`NOPATCH`** Disable runtime patching. Without runtime patching the
  TSR will be much slower, but the I/O timing will be much more
  regular, which might help with software that's very timing
  sensitive.


## System requirements

- 386 CPU
- A compatible memory manager:
  - EMM386 version 4.46 or later (tested with version 4.49 from MS-DOS 6.22)
  - QEMM 7.03 or later (tested with QEMM versions 7.03, 7.5, 8.0, 9.01)
  - JEMM 5.78

EMS memory is _not_ required. If you don't use software that requires
EMS memory, you can load EMM386 with the `NOEMS` parameter.

## Source code

This program compiles with OpenWatcom, use the `build.sh` script.
You'll also need Python 3 and [the Ragel state machine
compiler][Ragel].
