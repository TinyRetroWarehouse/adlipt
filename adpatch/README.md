# ADPATCH

ADPATCH can patch games to directly support the OPL2LPT. After
patching, configure the game for an Adlib sound card (in case this
isn't auto-detected).

Caveats:

- Patching can break sound card support (including support for
  non-Adlib cards).
- Patched games might only work on the computer where the patch was
  done. This is because the patch hardcodes the parallel port I/O
  address, which I believe might vary from computer to computer.

Pros compared to the ADLiPT TSR:

- No need for 386 CPU
- No Adlib emulation slowdown
- Can work with protected mode games

Cons:

- Patches need to be written for each game by hand

## Compressed EXEs

DOS software often shipped with compressed EXEs. Such EXEs need to be
unpacked before they can be patched. ADPATCH will detect the more
common compression schemes and warn about them ("This file might be
compressed"). If you see such a warning, you should try decompressing
it and running ADPATCH again. I recommend [Ben Castricum's
UNP](http://unp.bencastricum.nl/) decompressor, it will handle pretty
much all formats.

## Working games

- Sierra
  - Games using the "SCI" engine. Patch `ADL.DRV`.
- id Software
  - The Commander Keen series
  - Wolfenstein 3D
  - DOOM (v1.9 tested)
  - DOOM II
- Softdisk
  - Keen Dreams
  - Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue
  - Dave Does Nutz
- Apogee
  - Bio Menace

Games not listed almost certainly will not work (sorry).
Patches welcome :)

## Compilation

To compile a DOS executable using OpenWatcom, use the `build.sh`
script. To compile with GCC, use the `buildunix.sh` script.

You'll also need Python 3, the NASM assembler and [the Ragel state
machine compiler][Ragel].

## Writing patches

The patches are stored in YAML files in the `patterns/` directory.
Each file can have multiple patches, I try to keep related patches
together. Generally each target needs two patches, one for the Adlib
detection routine and one for the actual Adlib I/O.

Each patch consists of a search pattern and a replacement code fragment.

### Search patterns

The search pattern is specified as an assembly fragment, but there are
certain special keywords that can be used.

**ANYBYTE, ANYWORD, ANYDWORD** can be used as a wildcard for an
arbitrary 1/2/4 byte value. For example:

    mov dx, word ptr [ANYWORD]
    out dx, al

In this pattern, the address of the variable is not important and
might differ in different builds of the game. So it's best to accept
anything.

**BEGIN/ALT/END** mark alternative code sequences. For example:

    BEGIN
      mov dx, 0x389
    ALT
      inc dx
    END

This is useful to match slight variations in a single pattern.

**BEGIN/REPEAT** marks possible repetition. For example:

    BEGIN
      in al, dx
    REPEAT

The fragment must appear at least once.

**BEGIN/OPTION** marks a fragment that might or might not appear.

    BEGIN
      nop
    OPTION

#### Problems:

ANYBYTE/ANYWORD won't work for relative offsets. So instead of `call
ANYWORD`, you'll have to write `db 0xE8, ANYBYTE, ANYBYTE`. Same for
short jumps.

Surprisingly often x86 instructions have multiple encodings. For
example, `mov ax,bx` might be encoded as `89 D8` or as `8B C3`. If
NASM picks the wrong encoding, you'll have to spell out the bytes
explicitly.

The implementation is a gross hack.

### Replacement code

The replacement code is an ordinary assembly fragment. The keyword
PORT can be used *once* to get the parallel port I/O address.

ADPATCH ships with a few standard replacements that can be `%include`d:

- `standard.s`: the standard OPL2LPT code. Expects the OPL2 register
  in AL and the data in AH.
- `standard32.s`: same, as 32-bit code.
- `compact.s`: a slower but smaller version. Will pop register and data
  (separately) from the stack.

If the replacement code is shorter than the matched fragment, it will
be padded with NOPs.
